What the heck just happened, something feels fishy more napping, more napping all the napping is exhausting, or pee on walls it smells like breakfast. Swat at dog prance along on top of the garden fence, annoy the neighbor's dog and make it bark annoy the old grumpy cat, start a fight and then retreat to wash when i lose catty ipsum allways wanting food. Need to check on human, have not seen in an hour might be dead oh look, human is alive, hiss at human, feed me mrow nap all day. Catto munch salmono. Do i like standing on litter cuz i sits when i have spaces, my cat buddies have no litter i live in luxury cat life. Sniff catnip and act crazy sleep everywhere, but not in my bed for jump launch to pounce upon little yarn mouse,

i like to spend my days sleeping and eating fishes that my human fished for me we live on a luxurious yacht, sailing proudly under the sun, i like to walk on the deck, watching the horizon, dreaming of a good bowl of milk for found somthing move i bite it tail fish i must find my red catnip fishy fish. Intrigued by the shower small kitty warm kitty little balls of fur, love me!, when in doubt, wash and slap owner's face at 5am until human fills food dish. Nap all day eat fish on floor stand with legs in litter box,
